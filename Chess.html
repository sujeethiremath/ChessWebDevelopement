    <p>Chess is a 1500 years old game. The game is originally invented in India Earlier it was known as Chaturanga. It means 'the four divisions', meaning infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Chess was introduced to Persia from India. And from Persia, it gradually spread across the whole world.</p>
    <p>The rules of chess changed many times until the 1880s. But according to modern chess games, it is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Play involves no hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece type moves differently.  The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.</p>
    <p>By convention, chess game pieces are divided into white and black sets. White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play.</p>
    <p>Following are the rules for moving the different pieces: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>King : Moves one square in any direction.</li>
      <li>Rook : Moves any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
      <li>Bishop : Moves any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
      <li>Queen : Moves any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
      <li>knight : Moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal.The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</li>
      <li>Pawn : Moves forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps used to create the chessboard HTML & CSS.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Saved the empty file with the HTML extension to enable autocomplete in the Atom editor.</li>
      <li>In the header section provided the title for the HTML page.</li>
      <li>In the body section under the table tags, created the rows of cells with the use of Unicode characters to represent pieces in the chessboard game.</li>
      <li>Created a new CSS file.</li>
      <li>set attributes for body tag to make the contents fir to the center.</li>
      <li>For changing the background color of the cells in a row, first gave the unique ids to each row (8 rows 8 ids). And using n-child selector with odd-even values colored the cells with two different colors.</li>
      <li>Used w3schools CSS colors to choose the color.</li>
    </ol>
